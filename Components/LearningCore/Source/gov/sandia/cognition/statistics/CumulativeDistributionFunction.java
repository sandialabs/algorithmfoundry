/**
 * Functionality of a cumulative distribution function.  The CDF returns the
 * probability that the distribution takes a value less than a given input.
 * That is, CDF(x) = Probability(all z less than x).  Additionally, any CDF has
 * the following properties: it is nonnegative, nondecreasing,
 * CDF(-infinity)=0, CDF(infinity)=1.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Note that CumulativeDistributionFunction is NOT a DistributionFunction,
 * but merely an Evaluator.  This is because a DistributionFunction is meant
 * for PMFs/PDFs.
 * @param <NumberType> Type of Number used as the domain.
