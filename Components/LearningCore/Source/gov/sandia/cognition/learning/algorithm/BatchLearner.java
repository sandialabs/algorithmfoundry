/**
 * The {@code BatchLearner} interface defines the general functionality
 * of an object that is the implementation of a data-driven, batch  machine 
 * learning algorithm. It unifies the interfaces for both supervised and 
 * unsupervised learning, but as such is extremely general. The interface 
 * defines that a learning algorithm takes in some type of data and produces 
 * some type of object as output from the data.
 * <BR><BR>
 * Typically the input to the learning algorithm will be some collection of
 * data (training data) and the output will be some form of pattern recognizer 
 * (classifier/categorizer).
 * <BR><BR>
 * The design pattern for machine learning algorithms is to have all the
 * parameters and configuration of the algorithm set on the {@code BatchLearner}
 * object (usually as a Java Bean) and then the data is passed in using the
 * learn method to create the result object of the learning algorithm.
 * <BR><BR>
 * The interface is for a "batch" machine learning algorithm because the call
 * to the learn method is expected to create a usable object from scratch using
 * the provided data.
 * <BR><BR>
 * If you implement this without really using a learning algorithm you will 
 * make the authors very sad (especially Justin).
 *
 * @param   <DataType> The type of the data that the algorithm uses to perform
 *          the learning. For example, a 
 *          {@code Collection<InputOutputPair<Vector, Double>>} or 
 *          {@code String}.
 * @param   <ResultType> The type of object created by the learning algorithm.
 *          For example, a {@code FeedforwardNeuralNetwork}.
