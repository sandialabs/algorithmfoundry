/**
 * The <code>Kernel</code> interface the functionality required from an object
 * that implements a kernel function. A kernel is a function that takes two 
 * arguments and returns a double that is equivalent to the inner-product 
 * between two vectors in a high-dimensional space. That is, a kernel must 
 * satisfy Mercer's conditions and produce a matrix that is positive 
 * semi-definite. Typically the inner-product is not actually computed by 
 * creating the high-dimensional representation, but instead is computed quickly 
 * such that the result would be equivalent to operating in that 
 * high-dimensional space.
 *
 * @param  <InputType> The type of the input to the Kernel. For example, Vector.
